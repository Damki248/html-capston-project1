    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <p>
        I dont have a lot of work experience in IT sectors, but here are some of them:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Graphical designer:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As a part of my education on my Faculty I had to do some practical work 
                        in any kind of IT sectors.

                        Since we were learning Blender in that time (and I really liked it) I found
                        a company "Kreativni odjel d.o.o." which did some work with graphical design.

                        I got in touch with them and we agreed to make a project of a refinery that 
                        was meant to be destroyed.

                        You can check an example in the photo.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <img src="./assets/images/graphical_design_example.jpg" />
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Customer support agent at Hrvatski Telekom
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I'm currently working at Hrvatski Telekom as a customer service agent.

                        It is a really nice job since I can use a lot of complex softwares and hone my skills
                        of communication with people, listening to their problems, and find a way to fix them.
                        With that, I learned to multitask which was a big problem before this job. Together with all
                        said, I learned to be a team player and find solutions together with my team and team leader.
